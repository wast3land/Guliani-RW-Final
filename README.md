Hey Professor Jones, welcome to our final project, a text based dungeon crawler with mystery elements!

A few quick notes:\
  First off, please excuse any bugs you might find. This project was perhaps a little too ambitious and we didn't have the all time 
  we needed to properly QA test and bugfix. We should have gotten all the game-breaking ones, but it's entriely possible that you might find
  some we missed, so we thank you in advance for your patience.

  Second, the game isn't the most user friendly. It has to be run from the Command Line, preferably from a MacOS device. Here are the steps:\
    1. Download the files from the repository as a .ZIP file and unzip them into your downloads folder\
    2. Open up Terminal on your Mac\
    3. Enter the command "cd" (without the quotes) into the Terminal\
    4. Then, enter "cd Downloads" (no quotes)\
    4. Next, enter "cd Guliani-RW-Final"\
    5. Then, enter "cd final"\
    6. Finally, run "python3 tui.py" and the game should start

  If you run into an issue with Step 6 involving Python not being installed on your machine,
  please follow this online guide to get it installed, then do all the steps again: [https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-python/](url)

  From there, the game should be fairly self-explanatory, but an important note, entering the command\
  "exit" at any prompt will save the game and return you to the Command Line (do step 6 to start the game again)

  As a final note, if you do encounter any bugs that break the game, entering the command "reset" at a prompt will\
  erase your save data and start fresh game.
