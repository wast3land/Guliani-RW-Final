Hey Professor Jones, welcome to our final project, a text based dungeon crawler with mystery elements!

A few quick notes:
  First off, please excuse any bugs you might find. This project was perhaps a little too ambitious and we didn't have the all time 
  we needed to properly QA test and bugfix. We should have gotten all the game-breaking ones, but it's entriely possible that you might find
  some we missed, so we thank you in advance for your patience. 

  Second, the game isn't the most user friendly. It has to be run from the Command Line, preferably from a MacOS device. Here are the steps:
    1. Download the files from the repository as a .ZIP file and unzip them into your downloads folder. 
    2. Open up Terminal on your Mac
    3. Enter the command "cd" (without the quotes) into the Terminal
    4. Next, enter "cd Guliani-RW-Final"
    5.
